Hey, gang, the cat's away!
*music plays*
That oughta make'em paranoid.

Denise, it's Jon...
Hey Howzabout just the two of us going out on New year's Eve?
Guess it'll just be the one of us.
Are you sure you want to go out with you?

Karate cat demonstrates his art on a table leg.
HIIYAH! *Snap*
Karate cat also demonstrates incredible lack of foresight.

Ahhh... A filling meal at a greasy diner.
*Burrraaaap*
Then home to fall asleep on the couch in front of the TV!
Check!
It just doesn't get any better than this.

I wonder what's going on today?
Ow!
Besides having a sore neck.

I have got to meet that girl over there, Garfield.
Hi! Wanna Arm-Wrestle?
Pig!
The undisputed king of the opening line.

Hi, Lisa, it's Jon Arbuckle...
I have to tickets to the Polka Joe Concert at the Bowl-O-Rama for this New Year's Eve. Care to join me?
I just learned three new words.
Unsuitable for a comic strip, no doubt.

Here it is, the world's greatest alarm clock.
It has hands that glow in the dark.
And a snooze button with a three day delay.

So you'll be a year older...so what?
Birthday's are a celebration of life!
Yeah! we can decorate your walker with streamers and everything!
Who let him in?

Hey Garfield, I have got a joke for you.
Ha!Ha!Ha!Ha! 
Don't you think I should tell you the joke before you laugh?
Let's not ruin the moment, Jon.

Hi, Jon.
What's with the feathers?
Leftovers.

Garfield's in for a big surprise. I put an alarm on the refrigerator.
It's the first rule for successfully living with a cat.
You must be smarter than the cat.

The self improvement bit is beginning to bug me. I feel like a goody-two-shoes.
Maybe my old personality wasn't all that bad...
The gluttony, laziness, and cynicism lent a little texture.

In the interest of national security, I'm afraid I'm going to have to confiscate that hamburger.
Yes, there is a top secret formula in here which i am going to have to memorize and eat.
You live in your own little world, don't you, Garfield?
There's nothing little about it.

*Searches*
Now where could my pipe be?
GARFIELD!!!

Don't you have anything to do?
I've been keeping an eye on that crack in the ceiling.
Now I don't have anything to do.

Hey there beautiful.
What?!...Oh, I'm sorry.
Wrong number. That was Bob the Butcher.
Way to ruin our bacon connection.

Cut that out, Garfield.
If you don't stop staring at me, I'm leaving the room!
There!Happy?!
Quite.

Dieting is like show business.
The weight always returns for an encore.

Hi, there...I'm Jon Arbuckle. Im a cartoonist, and this is my cat Garfield.
Hi, there. I'm Garfield. I'm a cat and this is my cartoonist, Jon.
Our only thought is to entertain you.
Feed me.

A mouse! Get it!
Garfield! You didn't even try!
Show me a good mouser, and I'll show you a cat with bad breath.

All I ever do is eat and sleep, eat and sleep, eat and sleep.
There must be more to a cat's life than that.
But I hope not.

Garfield, you made me breakfast!
What is it?
I'll give you a hint.
MMM....
What has six legs and can't swim in orange juice?

How much are the plane tickets?...Uh, do you have anything cheaper?
That could be fatal!
I don't think they want our business, Garfield.
Where's the competition for the low rollers these days?

Get the cat...Blah, blah, blah.
Help, help...and so on.
I think the magic has gone out of our relationship.

I know why you won't go out with me, Ellen.
It's because I don't drive a big fancy car!
Ok...and I'm boring.
Are you going to take the car back?

What is love to you, Garfield?
Love is that exhilarating feeling you get when a vision of beauty comes walking to you.
In fact, I just had that experience.
When you saw me?
When I saw my mirror this morning.

Ah, yes. There it is. That old Christmas Spirit is in the air once again.
What would you like for breakfast, Garfield?
A blueberry waffle, please.
And a car, a pony, and a villa in the south of France!

I think I should probably go grocery shopping.
I agree wholeheartedly.
When you get down to sucking soy sauce packet's, it's time.

All right, you caught me...Now what?
Uh, I don't remember.
We could sing a song.
I don't even want to know.

You know, Garfield, You should really be thankful for the food you eat.
I am, Jon. I am.
I'm also thankful for the food you eat.

Busy day.
Don't I know it!
It seems like the harder I work, the behinder I get.
One of the other cats called in sick.
Are you listening to me?
So I had to take two naps at the same time!

Oh good. Here come more girl scouts with more cookies.
Rats!
They have a den mother riding point.

Liz...What a beautiful name!
Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz Liz.
Where are you going?
To change my name to Betty.

Everyone ready for movie night?
Tonight's film: Polka, Polka, Polka! The untold history of the accordion.
And-a-one,and-a-two...

Let's go dancing!
You mean where people can see us?!
What would make Liz so shy?
I don't know this man.

Garfield, I found Pooky!
Whoah! What's happening?!
Those latent urges die hard.

GARFIELD!
Fall asleep in your food again?
Don't ask stupid questions. Just get the chisel.

Why don't you like me?
Youre wishy-washy, crude, and a twerp.
I mean aside from that.

I think my tie is too long.
I have just the thing.
Good evening, my dear.

Your cat is extremely overweight, Mr.Arbuckle. It could lead to serious heart problems.
Not to worry.
I don't think Garfield has a heart.
See?!

STOP RIGHT THERE!
Sometimes that's all a cat understands.

You should always follow my lead.
I don't know about "Always".

Not everyone is impressed by you.
Well then, not everyone is paying attention.

Oh, No! Fire Arrows!
I'm a goner!
A cat always goes down with his fence!

Hey, Garfield, what do you thnk of the new turtleneck sweater mom made you?
You're right.
It isn't very flattering, is it?
